# MoravecWalker

This project is a networked creative coding experience made using Node.js, Socket.io, and p5.js.

## Description
A collaborative, two-player walking simulator exploring **Moravec's Paradox**. Two users must connect via mobile devices to act as the "Left Leg" and "Right Leg," strictly alternating inputs to control a digital figure made of code.

## How to Run
1.  Ensure **Node.js** is installed.
2.  Open your terminal in the project folder and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    node app.js
    ```
3.  **To Play:**
    * **Player 1 & 2:** Connect two mobile devices to the same Wi-Fi as the computer. Open `http://[Your-Computer-IP]:3000` in the browser.
    * **Observer:** Open `http://localhost:3000` on your computer (if not playing).

## Tools Used
* **Node.js** (Server Logic)
* **Socket.io** (Real-time Communication)
* **p5.js** (Visuals)
* **HTML / JavaScript**
